Warning messages:
1: In check_directory(save_path, recursive = TRUE) :
  The following given directory did not exist and was created by 'check_directory': Results/gbex/Switzerland/
2: UNRELIABLE VALUE: One of the foreach() iterations (‘doFuture-1’) unexpectedly generated random numbers without declaring so. There is a risk that those random numbers are not statistically sound and the overall results might be invalid. To fix this, use '%dorng%' from the 'doRNG' package instead of '%dopar%'. This ensures that proper, parallel-safe random numbers are produced via the L'Ecuyer-CMRG method. To disable this check, set option 'future.rng.onMisuse' to "ignore".
